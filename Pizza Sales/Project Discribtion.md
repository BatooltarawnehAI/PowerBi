## 📌 Project Objective
Build a Power BI dashboard to analyze pizza sales and deliver insights on revenue, customer behavior, and product performance using key KPIs, charts, and SQL queries.

## 📊 Required KPIs
1. **Total Revenue**  
2. **Average Order Value**  
3. **Total Pizzas Sold**  
4. **Total Orders**  
5. **Average Pizzas Per Order**  

## 📈 Required Charts
- Daily trend for total orders  
- Monthly trend for total orders  
- Percentage sales by pizza category  
- Percentage sales by pizza size  
- Top 5 best sellers (by revenue, quantity, orders)  
- Bottom 5 best sellers (by revenue, quantity, orders)  

## 🛠 SQL Queries Used
Queries were written to calculate:  
- Revenue, average order value, pizzas sold, total orders, avg pizzas/order  
- Daily & monthly order trends  
- Sales % by category and size  
- Top/Bottom 5 pizzas by revenue, quantity, and orders  

## ✅ My Work
- Collected and cleaned the dataset (`pizza_sales.csv`).  
- Wrote SQL queries to generate KPIs and chart data.  
- Imported data into **Power BI** and built the dashboard.  
- Designed visuals for KPIs, trends, category/size analysis, and best/worst sellers.  
- Added interactivity (filters, slicers) for deeper insights.
